# Web Development

Build lean, maintainable browser software. Treat HTML, CSS, browser APIs, and
the app's interaction model as the platform. Add framework and package weight
only when it earns its keep.

## Current Default Stack

- Vite, Svelte 5, TypeScript, CodeMirror 6.
- SvelteKit only when routing, SSR, server actions, or file-based app structure
  are actually useful. For a Rust-served SPA, plain Vite is usually enough.
- Component CSS plus shared CSS variables. Tailwind only if already present.
- Native `fetch` behind a typed transport/client boundary. No Axios by default.
- lucide-svelte for icons where available.
- Vitest for unit tests, svelte-check for Svelte/TypeScript validation.

## Svelte 5 Rules

- Use runes mode deliberately: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`,
  `$bindable`.
- Prefer `$derived` for derived data. Do not use `$effect` to synchronize state
  that can be computed.
- Use `$effect` only for side effects: DOM integration, subscriptions, timers,
  network calls, third-party imperative libraries. Return cleanup functions.
- Keep `$effect` state writes rare and justified; avoid update loops.
- Use `.svelte.ts` modules for shared reactive state when a feature needs
  cross-component state. Keep modules focused by concern.
- Avoid React patterns: no hook-shaped abstractions, no prop drilling where a
  small state module or context is clearer, no component trees that exist only
  to shuttle callbacks.
- Use typed `$props()` destructuring. Use `$bindable` sparingly; bound props
  are for true two-way component state such as inputs, resize widths, and open
  state, not general data flow.
- Use snippets for reusable render regions when component extraction would add
  ceremony without a clearer boundary.

## Vite Rules

- Keep `vite.config.ts` short. Prefer Vite defaults and official plugins.
- Treat `index.html` as source and the app entry point.
- Use Vite env variables only with the `VITE_` prefix; never put secrets in
  frontend env.
- Keep assets in the Vite asset pipeline unless they are true public root
  assets.
- Split heavy routes/surfaces with dynamic imports when initial bundle size or
  startup cost warrants it.
- For Rust-backed apps, build static assets that Rust serves or embeds. Use a
  dev proxy only as a development convenience.

## CodeMirror 6 Rules

- Respect CM6's model: immutable `EditorState`, transactions, facets,
  extensions, state fields, view plugins, decorations.
- Do not mutate CodeMirror state or DOM directly. Dispatch transactions or use
  documented extension points.
- Use compartments for dynamic configuration such as language, theme,
  read-only, keymaps, line wrapping, or feature toggles.
- Use state fields for editor-owned state that must track transactions.
- Use view plugins for shallow DOM-facing views over editor state. Implement
  cleanup in `destroy`.
- Use decorations/widgets for presentation. Keep the markdown/source document
  as the single backing document; WYSIWYG is a presentation layer.
- Keep keymaps explicit and ordered. Use precedence when a feature-specific
  keymap must beat defaults.
- Destroy EditorView instances on unmount.

## Baseline App Shell

- A workspace acts like a small window manager: panes, tabs, split panes,
  active focus, drag resize, session restore.
- Feature surfaces are window-level overlays: files, search, graph, assistant,
  settings, history, diff, modal prompts, disconnect/auth states.
- Overlays share shell behavior: backdrop, stacking, Escape handling, safe-area
  gutters, maximized/restored sizing, animation policy.
- Overlay chrome convention:
  - maximize/restore on the left,
  - primary title/context in the center,
  - hamburger/actions and close on the right,
  - optional right inspector,
  - optional left navigation/outline pane.
- Design for future detachable/floating overlays, minimize-to-dock, z-order,
  persistent placement, and theme skins such as CDE, WindowMaker, or macOS.
  Do not bake modal assumptions into feature internals.

## Shell Architecture

- Separate shell primitives from feature bodies:
  - `OverlayShell`: backdrop, stacking, panel sizing, safe-area rules.
  - `Inspector`: resizable side-pane chrome only.
  - `HamburgerMenu` or equivalent: one triggerless/triggered menu primitive.
  - Feature components: own data loading, body rendering, and action lists.
- App root owns global overlays and global keyboard handling.
- Overlay stack is central; Escape closes one topmost overlay, not every mounted
  overlay.
- Menus are command surfaces. Header hamburger and right-click context menu
  should render the same action list.
- Preserve native context menus in text inputs unless the app provides a better
  editor-specific command menu.
- Use portals for fixed menus/popovers when transformed ancestors would break
  viewport positioning.

## Command And Keyboard Model

- Maintain a central shortcut/command registry.
- Stable command ids are the contract. Chords are platform-specific bindings
  to those ids.
- The registry should feed:
  - browser key handling,
  - native/Tauri key remapping,
  - visible menu chord labels,
  - shortcut tables,
  - generated CLI/help text.
- Match browser-reserved chords honestly. Use web fallbacks where browsers own
  shortcuts; let native shells intercept OS/browser-reserved chords and
  dispatch command events.
- Prefer `KeyboardEvent.code` when modifier keys can change `key`, especially
  Option/Alt on macOS.
- Commands should be invokable from keyboard, menu, context menu, and host
  bridge without duplicating behavior.

## Tauri And Host Readiness

- Keep the SPA usable in a normal browser.
- Native wrappers should add capabilities through a small host bridge that
  dispatches stable command events and injects platform metadata.
- Prefer one HTTP/WebSocket transport and one typed API surface across browser
  and native. Do not split protocol paths unless it removes real complexity.
- Avoid `window.prompt` and `window.confirm`; use in-app modals that work in
  WebViews.
- Keep native detection localized to host integration and presentation labels.

## Organization

- Keep modules aligned by responsibility, not by framework artifact type.
- Shared state modules should expose a small domain API, not a junk drawer of
  writable globals.
- Prefer explicit domain types for pane ids, overlay ids, command ids, tab
  state, inspector targets, and file kinds.
- Split large components when there is a real boundary: shell vs body, chrome
  vs content, data loading vs rendering, command list vs menu primitive.
- Avoid barrels unless the project already uses them and tree-shaking impact is
  understood.
- Comments explain constraints and non-obvious tradeoffs, not what the code
  says.

## Quality Bar

- Semantic HTML and keyboard accessibility are baseline requirements.
- Every interactive surface must have keyboard reachability, focus behavior,
  and sane ARIA where native elements are not enough.
- Layout must be stable: fixed-format controls need stable dimensions and text
  must not overlap.
- Mobile and small-window behavior must be intentional, even when a feature is
  desktop-first.
- No decorative framework churn. Prefer small, boring components and explicit
  state transitions.
- Verify with `npm run check`, focused Vitest tests, and manual interaction.
- For shell changes, explicitly check overlay stacking, Escape behavior,
  menu placement, context-menu parity, command dispatch, focus restoration,
  and safe-area/mobile gutters.
